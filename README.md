+ Project summary: When one wants to become a host on Airbnb, one of the questions to crack is how exactly to describe the property to be successful. In the project our team investigated most and least successful listings from textual analysis perspective. Questions we decided to answer are about differences between the two from linguistic standpoint. We used different types of text mining techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Via observing the differences, we created a list of recommendations regarding what does signifies a successful write up and what is likely to signal unsuccessful listing. We didn't go beyond textual analysis and focused on a write up itself. The value of our recommendations is that they do not require any financial investment, but still might positively influence the profile of the host. For analysis we sampled listings from a dataset of ~30,000 observations; we used stratified sample to control for location and price range. To differentiate between successful and unsuccessful listings we used a composite indicator, built from rating score, several popularity measures, and super host indicator.
